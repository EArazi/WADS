            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><font size="2">I 
              was born in Lambeth in south London where I lived until the age 
              of six. We then moved to Forest Gate which at the time was a more 
              Jewish community which had several shuls within walking distance. 
              West Ham shul, affectionately know as Earlham Grove Shul, was to 
              become the family shul (and later my first post!) It was here that 
              I really acquired my love for community shuls. </font></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><font size="2">I 
              attended Beis Shammai Grammar School which started out in Stamford 
              Hill and then moved to the leafy suburbs of Chigwell in Essex. At 
              the age of sixteen, the time had arrived for me to move out and 
              start my Yeshiva life. First stop: Morristown, New Jersey in America 
              where I stayed for two years. Still young, I needed to move on. 
              Everyone seemed to be going to Israel and there really was only 
              one place for me: Kfar Chabad - an idyllic village set off the main 
              road amongst the famous orange groves just outside Tel Aviv. I remained 
              here for seven years, completing my studies with Semicha from Rabbi 
              Yeroslavski of Kiryat Melachi. </font></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><font size="2">Returning 
              home, I worked with my parents in the family business, a kosher 
              delicatessen. The Jewish community had declined over the years and 
              when the rabbi of our shul left, I officially took on the position 
              as minister. I was there for four years before it officially closed 
              in 2004. Having married in 2002, my wife and I moved to Edgware 
              where we lived for two years. In 2003 I began working in the Kashrut 
              Division of the London Beth Din where I continue to work until today.

              2006 we moved once again to Watford. Now with two sons, we feel
