        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000099"><b>What 
          is Shavuot? </b><br>
          The Torah was given by G d to the Jewish people on Mount Sinai more 
          than 3300 years ago. Every year on the holiday of Shavuot we renew our 
          acceptance of G d's gift and G d 're-gives' the Torah. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000099">The 
          word Shavuot means 'weeks'. It marks the completion of the seven week 
          counting period between Pesach and Shavuot. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000099">The 
          giving of the Torah was a far-reaching spiritual event-one that touched 
          the essence of the Jewish soul for all times. Our Sages have compared 
          it to a wedding between G d and the Jewish people. Shavuot also means 
          'oath' and on this day G d swore eternal devotion to us, and we in turn 
          pledged everlasting loyalty to Him. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000099">The 
          holiday of Shavuot is a two-day holiday, beginning at sundown of the 
          5th of Sivan and lasting until nightfall of the 7th of Sivan. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000099"><b>The 
          Ten Commandments </b><br>
          We stood at the foot of the mountain. So did our grandparents and great-grandparents 
          before them. The souls of all Jews, from all times, came together to 
          hear the Ten Commandments from G d Himself. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000099">This 
          year, on Friday 29th May, come to shul and hear the Ten Commandments 
          and reaffirm the covenant with G d and His Torah. This is a special 
          custom for men, women and children. We hope to make the reading special 
          for all the children attending. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000099"><b>Why 
          Mt. Sinai? </b><br>
          Everybody knows that the Ten Commandments were given by G-d on Mount 
          Sinai. But why Mount Sinai in particular? The Midrash tells us that 
          Mount Sinai was not the highest and most splendid mountain. In fact 
          it is described as being the lowest of all the mountains which might 
          have been chosen. Nonetheless, G-d chose Mount Sinai for the Giving 
          of the Torah in order to teach an important message: to tell us that 
          humility is a prerequisite to the learning of Torah. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000099">Torah 
          comes from G-d. When hearing an instruction from the Torah, we need 
          the ability to listen. This is a rare quality: usually our own ego gets 
          in the way. We hear our own ideas, not what the Torah is saying. Humility 
          is the step beyond our ego, a mood of selflessness, which makes us receptive 
          to the Torah. Thus we say at the end of the daily Amidah prayer 'May 
          my soul be to all as the dust - open my heart to your Torah'. A Chassidic 
          comment on this idea goes a step further. Surely, if the emphasis is 
          on humility, why choose a mountain at all? Wouldn't the message have 
          been more keenly felt if the Torah were given on a flat plain, or even 
          better, in a valley? </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000099">This 
          puzzle is explained as follows. While humility is important, there are 
          also many occasions in Jewish life when a more determined and forceful 
          approach is demanded. Personal self- sacrifice, steadfastness in the 
          face of ridicule or contempt, the readiness to suffer for Judaism (as 
          Jews in Communist Russia did for many years) are responses that are 
          sometimes required. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000099">It 
          is interesting that right at the beginning of the Code of Jewish Law 
          comes the statement 'Do not be embarrassed by mockery and ridicule'. 
          If one were to waver in observance of a Jewish law simply because of 
          the derisive criticism of others, there would soon not be much observance 
          of Judaism left at all! </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000099">So 
          one needs both qualities: humility and strength. The ability to listen, 
          and also the firmness to be able to stand up against the current. Both 
          qualities are expressed in the image of Mount Sinai. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000099"><b>The 
          All Nighter </b><br>
          On the first night of Shavuot (Thursday night), Jews throughout the 
          world observe the centuries-old custom of conducting an all-night vigil 
          dedicated to Torah learning, and preparation for receiving the Torah 
          anew the next morning. One explanation for this tradition is that the 
          Jewish people did not rise early on the day G d gave the Torah, and 
          it was necessary for G d Himself to awaken them. To compensate for their 
          behavior, Jews have accepted upon themselves the custom of remaining 
          awake all night. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000099"><b>Eating 
          Dairy </b><br>
          It is customary to eat dairy foods on the first day of Shavuot. There 
          are a number of reasons for this custom - here are a few: </font></p>
        <ul>
          <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000099"> 
            On the holiday of Shavuot, a two-loaf bread offering was brought in 
            the Temple. To commemorate this, we eat two meals on Shavuot - first 
            a dairy meal, and then, after a short interruption, we eat the traditional 
            holiday meat-meal. </font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000099"> 
            With the giving of the Torah the Jews now became obligated to observe 
            the laws of Kosher. As the Torah was given on Shabbat no cattle could 
            be slaughtered nor could utensils be koshered, and thus on that day 
            they ate dairy. </font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000099"> 
            The Torah is likened to nourishing milk. Also, the Hebrew word for 
            milk is "chalav." When the numerical value of each of the letters 
            in the word chalav are added together - 8, 30, 2 - the total is forty. 
            Forty is the number of days Moses spent on Mount Sinai when receiving 
            the Torah.</font></li>
        </ul>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000099"><b>Going 
          Green </b><br>
          Since Shavuot is also called the "Harvest Festival," it is customary 
          to adorn the home and synagogue with fruits, flowers and greens. Furthermore, 
          our Sages relate that although Mount Sinai was situated in a desert, 
          when the Torah was given the mountain bloomed and sprouted flowers. 
          The </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000099"><b>Book 
          of Ruth </b><br>
          In many synagogues the Book of Ruth is read on the second day of Shavuot. 
          There are several reasons for this custom: </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000099">A) 
          Shavuot is the birthday and yahrtzeit (anniversary of passing) of King 
          David, and the Book of Ruth records his ancestry. Ruth and her husband 
          Boaz were King David's great-grandparents. <br>
          B) The scenes of harvesting described in the book of Ruth are appropriate 
          to the Festival of Harvest. <br>
          C) Ruth was a sincere convert who embraced Judaism with all her heart. 
          On Shavuot all Jews were converts -- having accepted the Torah and all 
          of its precepts. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000099"><b>Eruv 
          Tavshillin </b><br>
          It is forbidden on a holiday to do any act in preparation for the following 
          day,1 even if the following day is Shabbat. However, the sages created 
          a halachic device, called an eruv tavshilin, which allows one to cook 
          food on a holiday day for use on a Shabbat that immediately follows 
          it. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000099">This 
          year, Shavuot falls on Friday and Shabbat, so an eruv tavshilin is made 
          on Thursday afternoon before the holiday candles are kindled. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000099">This 
          eruv consists of a challah or two matzahs, and a cooked food, such as 
          meat, fish, or an unpeeled hard-boiled egg. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000099">Take 
          the food items (it is a good idea to wrap them in aluminium foil, or 
          another distinctive packaging, to easily keep them apart from the rest 
          of the foods in your home), and say: <b>Blessed are you, L-rd our G 
          d, king of the universe, who has sanctified us with his commandments, 
          and commanded us concerning the mitzvah of eruv. </b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000099"><b>Through 
          this [eruv] it shall be permissible for us to bake, cook, put away a 
          dish [to preserve its heat], kindle a light, prepare, and do on the 
          holiday all that is necessary for Shabbat -- for us and for all the 
          Israelites who dwell in this city. The eruv is put away until Shabbat, 
          when it is eaten. In many communities, it is customary to use the challah 
          or matzah as one of the two loaves of bread used at the Shabbat meal.
